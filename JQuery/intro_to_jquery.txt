Incorporating Jquery using CDN : 
Google CDN is most popular.
Use its link : 
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>

Make sure to insert Jquery src at the end of body and above all the other script tags

In case you want to insert the script tag inside head , then 
insert script tag for jquery first
then insert script tag for your own js
and inside your own js , write 
    $(document).ready(function(){
        //Type all the JS
    })
This makes sure that JQuery library has finished loading before we try to access it .
