Redux is an app level state management library

Redux library is responsibe for storing our data and giving us methods to update the data

React-Redux library is connect redux store to the react application

Store is a single piece of truth or a global state is the react app.
The way it all works : Store->UI->Action->Reducer->Store
const store=createStore(reducer,initialState)
store.getState() returns the initial state
store.dipatch(action)
Hence Store is nothing but {getState,dispatch}

How do we update the store? By dispatching an action

reducer function is used to update the state.It takes two arguments:state and action.

dispatch method sends actions to the store
action are objects which must have a type property

Dont ever mutate the state because redux is built on immutability

While checking for action types , For the default case , always make sure to return the old state otherwise functionality will go bananas

In a professional approach , we dont use store.getState and store.dispatch but use react-redux to connect our application to the store.
react redux provides Provider(wraps the app) and connect(used in components to access the info).Info refers to the current state and dispatch method
Connect is a higher order component i.e it returns the component.
connect() (Component)
connect has two arguments-> mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps.Both are functions

//mapStateToProps has access to the state.Whatever this function returns is the prop of the component.It also returns a dispatch method.
//Essentialy we are also mapping our dispatch function to dispatch props

//mapDispatchToProps also has two parameters:dispatch and ownProps.The forst method used to dispatch the actions while the second parameter contains the components props

//Concept of Action Creators:

See in the store , we have the initial states and the reducers.
Now in the code we can connect to the store and use two methods: 
    1. mapStateToProps
    2. mapDispatchToProps
using mapDispatchToProps , we return methods to dispatch actions
What we can do is to setup the functions that always returns a particular type(and we can also pass payload).Basically it is a function that returns the action object
