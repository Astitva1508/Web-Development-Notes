I had been playing extensivley till this year's March when some injuries started to flare up.I had back pain,as well as pain around my groin and anal(and some other related regions whose name I dont know).Then , I went to college in April. Here The previous issues revoked everytime I started playing football.I also had constipation issues.By July end , along with all these issues , my whole body started to vibrate when I went to sleep and I experienced pain even while walking.I consulted doctors but they didn't diagnose me with anything. In August, I went back home and consulted several doctors again.Although none of the doctors diagnosed me with anything, they gave me medications and I had some relief.I came back to college in September.Now I am going to tell the problem that I currently have.Now I have pelvic pain and pain near anal everytime I wake up.Also , I experience pubic pain, groin pain and pain in the related areas everytime I walk too much. I also have pain when I bend or lify my leg upward. I can barely play.

Side Note:
I had stopped masturbating since last December because I didnt find it meanigful.
I have a past history of OCD
