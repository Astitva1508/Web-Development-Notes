typing npm install -> installs all the dependencies listed in the package.json
It is iseful while transferring files from one system to another because we usually dont send node_modules folder so all the npm modules need to be reinstalled

dev dependencies are dependencies needed for development 
to install a dev dependency, use command->
    npm install --save-dev nodemon  OR
    nom install -D nodemon
